Deploying assetlinks.json to GitHub Pages

1) Open your Pages repo (likely tayden1990/tayden1990.github.io).
2) Create a folder named `.well-known` at the repo root.
3) Copy the file from this project: `site-assetlinks/.well-known/assetlinks.json` into that `.well-known` folder.
4) Create an empty file named `.nojekyll` in the root of your Pages repo (enables serving dot-directories).
5) Commit and push. Wait ~1â€“3 minutes.
6) Verify it loads in the browser:
   https://tayden1990.github.io/.well-known/assetlinks.json
